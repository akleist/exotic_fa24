Description: This is a simple simulator of a billiard ball implementation of a switch gate. It is a universal gate, so any combinational logic
can be made from this gate. Because it is a billiard ball gate it is also inherently reversible and conservative under ideal conditions (which can be simulated). To run
the simulation you must have pygame installed. Once running, there are options to select which balls are active and to start, reverse, or reset
the state of the simulation.
